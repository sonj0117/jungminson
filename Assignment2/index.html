    <h1>Good Doggie</h1>
    <p> Chateau Chien welcomes all of our furry friends to bring your person and train them to keep you happy. Whether you are just a pup getting to know
        your new family, a young dog learning your first tricks, or a more amture dog who needs an etiquette refresher, we have a class for you. 
     <br>

        Our trainers offer group classes where you can make some new friends and watch them train their people while you train yours. We also have private sessions if you are a bit shy or need something special.
